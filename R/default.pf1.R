#' Data adaptive candidate vector of penalty factors for L1 penalty in conditional logistic regression with covariates divided in blocks
#'
#' Computes a data adaptive vector of penalty factors for  blocks of covariates by fitting
#' a tentative penalized conditional logistic regression model. The penalty for the `i`th block is obtained
#' as the inverse of the arithmetic mean of coefficient estimates for its covariates.
#'
#'
#' @inheritParams penalized.clr
#' @param nfolds The number of folds used in cross-validation. Default is 10.
#' @param type.step1 Should the tentative model be fit on all covariates jointly (`comb`) or to each block separately (`sep`).
#' @param verbose Logical. Should the message about the obtained penalty factors be printed?
#' @return The function returns a list containing the  vector of penalty factors correspondng to different blocks.

#' @details Blocks that contain covariates with large estimated coefficients will obtain a smaller penalty.
#' If all estimated coefficients pertaining to a block are zero, the function returns a message.
#' A tentative conditional logistic regression model is fit either to each covariates block separately (`type.step1 = "sep"`) or  jointly to all blocks (`type.step1 = "comb"`).
#' Note that `unpenalized = NULL` is the only implemented option  in this function as of now.
