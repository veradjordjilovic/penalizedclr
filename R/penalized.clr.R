#' Penalized conditional logistic regression
#'
#' Fits conditional logistic regression models with L1 and L2 penalty allowing
#' for different penalties for different blocks of covariates.
#'
#' @param response The response variable, either a 0/1 vector or a factor with two levels.
#' @param stratum A numeric vector with stratum membership of each observation.
#' @param penalized A matrix of penalized covariates.
#' @param unpenalized A matrix of additional unpenalized covariates.
#' @param lambda The tuning parameter for L1. Either a single non-negative number,
#'  or a numeric vector of the length equal to the number of blocks. See p below.
#' @param alpha The elastic net mixing parameter, a number between 0 and 1.
#'              alpha=0 would give pure ridge; alpha=1 gives lasso. Pure ridge penalty is never obtained in this implementation since alpha must be positive.
#' @param p The sizes of blocks of covariates,
#'         a numerical vector of the length equal to the number of blocks,
#'         and with the sum equal to the number of penalized covariates.
#'         If missing, all covariates are treated the same and a single penalty is applied.
#' @param standardize Should the covariates be standardized, a logical value.
#' @param event  If response is a factor, the level that
#'              should be considered a success in the logistic regression.
#' @return A list with the following elements:
#'              \itemize{
#'                   \item \code{penalized} - Regression coefficients for the penalized covariates.
#'                   \item \code{unpenalized} - Regression coefficients for the unpenalized covariates.
#'                   \item \code{converged} - Whether the fitting process was judged to have converged.
#'                   \item \code{lambda} - The tuning parameter for L1 used.
#'                   \item \code{alpha} - The elastic net mixing parameter used.
#'                       }

#' @details The `penalized.clr` function fits a conditional logistic regression
#'  model for a given combination of L1 (`lambda`) and L2 penalties. L2 penalty is
#'  obtained from `lambda` and `alpha` as `lambda*(1-alpha)/(2*alpha)`.
#'  Note that `lambda` is a single number if all covariates are to be penalized
#'  equally, and a vector of penatlies, if predictors are divided in blocks (of sizes provided in
#'  `p`) that are to be penalized differently. The `penalized.clr` function
#'  is based on the Cox model routine available in the
#'  `penalized` package.
